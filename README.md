# JFLAPPractice

## Designed and implemented the following finite automata using JFLAP:
• DFA to recognize the language of all strings that have at most three
zeros.

• DFA to recognize the language of all strings that have an even number
of zeros and an odd number of ones.

• DFA to recognize the language of all strings that end with an even
number of zeros (i.e. the longest substring of 0s at the end of the string
is of even length)

• DFA to recognize the language of all strings that have a pattern 01 but
not 10
